    <h3>by Masli Leal</h3>
    <p>The internet offers many ways to pass time. 
    <p>Below are some of my favorite ways to do so.</p>

    <p>Youtube offers a plethora of videos of an extremely large variety in which you can easily spend your time viewing.</p>

    <h2>&lt;Sometimes&gt; Fresh Laughs</h2>
    <p>Reddit is a great place to find fresh new laughs.  The Jokes subreddit has a mix of old and new jokes to keep things funny.  However, I can't always vouche for how clean the jokes are...</p>

    <p>Sadly, there's no guarantee a particular page or even an entire website will be around forever.  Case in point: <a href="http://www.chucknorrisfacts.com">http://www.chucknorrisfacts.com</a>.

Fortunately, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/">Way Back Machine</a> website is constantly "crawling" websites and backing them up for posterity.  Here's a copy of http://www.chuchnorrisfacts.com from 2015:</p>
